# Speed of Sound with T

## Description

This is a collection of functions which take only one input: the temperature in degrees C. They return only one output: the speed of sound in that medium at the temperature you input.

## Functions

### c_cu_long 

Returns the longitudinal velocity in copper.

### c_cu_shear

Returns the shear velocity in copper

### c_PEEK_long

Returns the longitudinal velocity in PEEK.

### c_PEEK_shear

Returns the shear velocity in PEEK.

### c_water

Returns the longitudinal velocity in water.
